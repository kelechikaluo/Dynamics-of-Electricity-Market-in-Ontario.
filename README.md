# Dynamics-of-Electricity-Market-in-Ontario.
Investigating relationship between chosen National Economic Indicators and the demand and pricing of electricity in Ontario.

The objective of this project was to examine the dynamics of the Ontario Electricity Market through the lens of selected National Economic indicators, including the USDCAD exchange rate, interest rate, mortgage rate, inflation, commodity price index, and energy price index. The primary focus was to analyze how fluctuations in these indicators influence the Ontario Electricity Market, specifically its demand and average hourly price. The insights gleaned from this analysis could inform various applications such as trading strategies, policy decisions, and market forecasting.
